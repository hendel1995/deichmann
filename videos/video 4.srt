00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello and welcome to this tutorial.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,500
In this video we'll show you how you can
upload and edit an invoice.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,100
So let's begin.

4
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:11,466
In the Document Wizard
we navigate to the invoice portal.

5
00:00:12,066 --> 00:00:14,966
Then we press on upload

6
00:00:14,966 --> 00:00:18,333
and drag and drop our invoices csv.

7
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:21,100
And now your invoice line
item should appear here.

8
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:23,833
But as you can see, there
seems to be a mistake in one of them.

9
00:00:23,833 --> 00:00:28,133
So let's click on edit
and see what's going on here.

10
00:00:29,466 --> 00:00:31,200
Down below you can see that

11
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,200
there seems to be no matching order number
for this order.

12
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:38,900
So we check our order number
and we discovered

13
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:40,500
that there seems to be a typo.

14
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,700
So let's fix that.

15
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:45,433
And now
so you can see the error disappeared.

16
00:00:45,433 --> 00:00:48,100
At this stage we could already press save.

17
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,233
Move back to our overview
and send off our data.

18
00:00:51,833 --> 00:00:55,000
However, we can also choose to upload

19
00:00:55,033 --> 00:00:58,033
our additional documents,
which I'll show you how to do now.

20
00:00:58,466 --> 00:01:01,333
First of all I'm
going to add our invoice document.

21
00:01:01,333 --> 00:01:04,800
So I just drag and drop
our invoice PDF over here

22
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:08,466
and it should be uploaded.

23
00:01:08,466 --> 00:01:11,100
Afterwards
we can add our additional documents.

24
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:15,733
It is possible to attach a packing list
and preference certificate.

25
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,766
So let's start off our packing list.

26
00:01:18,766 --> 00:01:21,100
We just

27
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:24,100
drag and drop it over here.

28
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,200
We select the document type.

29
00:01:28,166 --> 00:01:31,000
And now we have to make sure

30
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
that we

31
00:01:34,033 --> 00:01:37,033
add the right document number.

32
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:43,900
And our document date.

33
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,333
Now let's add our preference document.

34
00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:51,300
Here we also have to pick a subtype.

35
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:55,100
Then we add our document number
and the correct date.

36
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,400
And let's not forget our document as well.

37
00:02:02,133 --> 00:02:02,966
Now that we are done

38
00:02:02,966 --> 00:02:05,966
with those steps, we just press save.

39
00:02:06,033 --> 00:02:08,100
And now we're back in our overview.

40
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:11,100
As you can see, all of our invoice
line items are now valid.

41
00:02:11,566 --> 00:02:16,266
And as you might also notice,
our invoice document has also been linked

42
00:02:17,066 --> 00:02:20,066
to all of our invoice line items.

43
00:02:20,766 --> 00:02:23,933
This happens
because the invoice number is matching.

44
00:02:26,066 --> 00:02:26,700
Our additional

45
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,733
documents, our packing list
and our preference certificate

46
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:33,633
has only been linked
to the first two invoice line items.

47
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:38,766
This is because these documents
only get linked to the invoice line items

48
00:02:39,233 --> 00:02:42,700
with the same invoice number
and the same order number

49
00:02:43,966 --> 00:02:47,100
as the invoice line item
that we originally attached it to.

50
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,400
So if we want to

51
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:56,000
add these documents to an invoice
line item with a different order

52
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
number, then we would have to select
this third position here.

53
00:02:59,033 --> 00:03:02,633
Click on edit again and repeat the same
steps again that we just went over.

54
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:06,166
Now if you want to manually add
another invoice line item,

55
00:03:06,433 --> 00:03:09,966
you can do so by pressing on the add
button up here.

56
00:03:10,233 --> 00:03:13,100
If you want to delete a single invoice
line item,

57
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,800
you can do so
by pressing the delete button.

58
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:19,800
If you want to delete all the invoice
line items and the attached documents,

59
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:23,466
you can do so
by pressing on the Delete file button.

60
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:24,900
Then everything will be gone.

61
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,833
However,
since we're done with this exercise

62
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:30,900
and everything seems to be in order,
we'll just press send now.

63
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,366
And in a minute,
all of our documents would be gone.

64
00:03:34,366 --> 00:03:39,500
In the next video, titled ‘Displaying
Sent Data’, we will show you how you can

65
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:43,166
look for the documents and invoices
that you have already sent.

66
00:03:43,733 --> 00:03:44,833
Thank you for your attention.

67
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:47,866
I hope you're familiar now
with the process

68
00:03:47,866 --> 00:03:50,566
of how to upload and edit an invoice.

69
00:03:50,566 --> 00:03:53,733

71
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:57,733
Thank you. Bye bye.
